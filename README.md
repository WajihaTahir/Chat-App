# Chat-App

Created a chat app using Reactjs and Firebase for storing the users data collection and chat collection. The users can signup and login and after that can be headed to the conversation page where they can add the other users. The media such as images are also stored in the particular conversations so users can access them directly under the conversations. The UI is simple and is created using CSS.

The app displays the time of the messages and online status of the users as well. The frequent/recent chat users are automatically added on the left side. You can also send images in the conversation.
